### Orienting Questions
- the pig images ===> EVERYBODY HAS THIS ISSUE
- showing the highest medal achieved 
- no IDs on the pigs so keys...? ==> anything unique is fine 
- rocket functions
- when should you break something into a new component? 
   - organizing the component tree (filtering in Navbar)
- one source of truth for state ( yesterday: animal shelter, button on individual animal )


### Reflections
- controlled forms ====> WORK ON THAT
- practice practice practice ===> GET DEM REPS
- creativity in solving thangs ===> USE YOUR ES6 SUGAR (spread, ternaries, etc)
