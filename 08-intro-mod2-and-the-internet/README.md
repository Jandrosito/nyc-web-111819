## Re-Introduction to the internet

* What is the internet?

  Internet - Communication between computers
  Web - Built on top of the internet, following certain protocols
  Browser - Window used to browse the web (Application)

  * What's the difference between static and dynamic websites? What are some of the benefits of a dynamic website?

  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee
  * http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html

* How can I find out the IP address of www.google.com using a terminal command? What kind of server makes this lookup possible?
  * DNS (Domain Name System)
  * `nslookup`
  * https://iplocation.com/

* What is a server? What is a client?

* What is the request / response cycle?
  - Anatomy of Request
    - URL/URI
    - Method: GET (POST, PATCH, DELETE)
    - body: content sent back to server
    - headers: for later 
  - Anatomy of Response
    - Status Code
    - 

* With a client and server, which makes the request? Which sends the response?

* What is a HTTP request? Make a few, using at least two of these tools: Google Chrome, Postman, curl

* What are the parts of a HTTP request
  * Use a web browser to find the headers for an HTTP request. What do you think these headers do?
  * What is usually in the body of an HTTP _response_?
  * What is a HTTP status code? What do the codes 200, 404, 500, 503, 302, 422 and 418 mean?
  * Why do we use HTTP verbs? What is the difference between what GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests do?
  * What is a URL? Which part of a URL is the scheme (protocol)? Where is the host? The port? The path? Query string?  What is the purpose of each of these parts?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Walk through `corneal new`
* Talk about `shotgun`

* Walk through Model View Controller \(MVC\) pattern and give an example
  * https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1no3yw_Vw4hBzGDlsEDcubvFnowi-Exjg9FW_VJid_U0/edit#slide=id.g378a2b8862_0_22
